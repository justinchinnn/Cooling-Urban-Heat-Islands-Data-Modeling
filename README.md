#  The 2025 EY Open Science AI and Data Challenge - Cooling Urban Heat Islands (UHI) Data Modeling

• Led a 3-member team in a global AI sustainability competition to model Urban Heat Island (UHI) hotspots using climate, satellite, and geospatial data

• Built a stacking ensemble model (XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression) with polynomial feature engineering and RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

• Integrated Sentinel-2 & Landsat satellite imagery (NDVI, Albedo, LST) with building footprint KML data, weather observations, and urban morphology using tools like GeoPandas, rioxarray, pyproj, and Rasterio

• Achieved:
R² = 0.849 (final submission)
Best cross-validated R² = 0.764
In-sample R² = 0.9914, Out-sample R² = 0.8078 (stacking ensemble)

• Tools & Skills: Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Rasterio, GeoPandas, rioxarray, pyproj, Planetary Computer API, geospatial machine learning, model ensembling, satellite data fusion, SDG-aligned climate modeling
